# Geometry Dash Savefile Fixer

This tool fixes the most common problem causing Geometry Dash 2.1 to fail to open (that being save file formatting).
This is a graphical, simplified version of the [Geometry-Dash-Savefile-Fix](https://github.com/HGStyle/GD-SaveFileFixer) made by HGStyle based on [previous work by WEGFan](https://github.com/WEGFan).
It was made for a very specific use-case more focused on providing something simple than something with a good user experience, so have low expectations...

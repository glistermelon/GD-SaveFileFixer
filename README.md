# Geometry Dash Savefile Fixer

This tool can fix most problems that make unable to open the game by the savefiles. (which the game will only launch if you move the savefiles to other folders.)
This is an ameliorated version of the [Geometry-Dash-Savefile-Fix](https://github.com/WEGFan/Geometry-Dash-Savefile-Fix) made by [WEGFan](https://github.com/WEGFan) but since he seems inactive now, and there are some issues opened, I wanted to help these people to don't lose their data. This is an entire rewrite of the code, I licensed it under [MIT License](https://hgstyle.mit-license.org/2023) so you can do almost anything you want on this software, including using it in closed-source projects and so on... Only 1 thing: credit me (plz). Thanks you all.
